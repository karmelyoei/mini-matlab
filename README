# Mini MATLAB

This project is part of an AI course supervised by Dr. Imad Natsheh. The goal is to build a mini version of MATLAB by constructing small neural networks from scratch. These neural networks are designed to solve problems related to classification and regression for various datasets. The project also includes functionality for visualizing the training and testing procedures.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mini-matlab.git
   ```

1. Navigate to the project directory:

  ```bash
  cd mini-matlab
  ```

1. Install the required dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


## Usage

Run the main script using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```


This will launch the Mini MATLAB application.
